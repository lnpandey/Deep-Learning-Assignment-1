Refer PA1.pdf for more information about the code
Have a look at working grad_descent_working.ipynb for jupyter notebook, easy to understand.
train.py is the main code which has the implementation of all the parts.
train.csv is training data with 784 features (28 X 28) 55000 data entries with an additional id as column 0 and label as column 785.
run.sh is the command to run train.py

Implemented vanilla Gradient Descent (gd), momentum based gd, nestrov-acclerarted gd, adam.
Activation function used: Sigmoid
Number of hidden layers are dynamic
